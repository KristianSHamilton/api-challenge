Observed Trends:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. On 8/7/2021 temperature across the globe peaks at around 30 degrees latitude, above the equator in the Northern Hemisphere.
2. There was very low cloud coverage between 30 and 40 degrees latitude on that day which seems very related to the high temperature.
3. On 8/07/2021 there was very little relationship between latitude and humidity acrossed the globe which is confusing because of my prior points... 
   Maybe linear regression would identify that relationship by narrowing the sample data closer to the equator?
